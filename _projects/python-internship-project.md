# Project: Python Development Internship (Cognifyz Technologies)

This project showcases the skills and foundational knowledge I developed during a comprehensive Python Development Internship with Cognifyz Technologies. The program was structured to build proficiency from fundamental concepts to practical, real-world applications through a series of hands-on tasks and challenges.

### 1. The Goal

The primary goal of this internship was to master core Python programming concepts and apply them to solve a variety of problems. The curriculum was designed to build a strong foundation by progressing through three levels of increasing complexity, culminating in a practical automation script that demonstrates real-world utility.

### 2. My Role & Contributions

As an **Intern Developer**, I was responsible for successfully completing all assigned tasks across the three skill levels. My contributions involved writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code for each challenge.

* **Level 1 (Foundational Skills):** I implemented scripts for common programming problems, demonstrating a solid grasp of core concepts.
    * Developed functions for **string manipulation** (reversal, palindrome checks).
    * Built tools for **user input and validation** (email validator, calculator with error handling).
    * Applied **conditional logic** to solve problems like temperature conversion.

* **Level 2 (Intermediate Challenges):** I tackled more complex logic and introduced interactivity and data handling.
    * Created an interactive **Number Guessing Game** using loops and the `random` module.
    * Developed a **Password Strength Checker** to analyze strings against multiple criteria.
    * Implemented a script for **file manipulation** to read a file and perform a word frequency count.

* **Level 3 (Advanced Application):** I applied my skills to a practical, real-world automation project.
    * Designed and built a **File Organizer Script** to automatically categorize files in a directory into subfolders based on their file type (e.g., images, documents, videos). This required using the `os` and `shutil` libraries for file system interaction.

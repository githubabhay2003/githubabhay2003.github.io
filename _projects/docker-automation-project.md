# Project: Docker Automation Tool

This is a command-line tool written in Python that provides a simple, menu-driven interface to manage common Docker operations on a Linux system.

### 1. The Goal
The main goal of this project was to simplify Docker management by abstracting away complex command-line syntax. It creates an interactive and user-friendly menu that allows users to perform routine tasks—such as installing Docker, managing containers, and pulling images—with simple numeric inputs, reducing the chance of errors and speeding up repetitive workflows.

### 2. My Role & Contributions
As the developer of this tool, I was responsible for:

* **Scripting and Logic:** I wrote the complete Python script that powers the menu, handles user input, and constructs the appropriate Docker commands to be executed on the system's shell.
* **User Interface Design:** I designed the command-line interface (CLI) to be intuitive and easy to navigate for users who may be new to Docker.
* **System Integration:** The tool is tightly integrated with the Linux environment, using system commands to manage the Docker service itself (start, stop, status) in addition to managing containers and images.

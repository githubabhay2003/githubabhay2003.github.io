# Project: Menu-Based Multi-Technology Automation

This project is a versatile, menu-driven command-line tool designed to simplify and automate complex operations across AWS, Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes.

[Back to Home](./index.md)

### 1. The Goal
The primary objective was to create a single, unified interface that would allow a user to perform dozens of administrative tasks (like launching an AWS EC2 instance, running a Docker container, or deploying a Kubernetes pod) without needing to remember the specific, often complex, commands for each technology. This tool improves efficiency, reduces human error, and makes advanced technologies more accessible.

### 2. My Role & Contributions
As the sole developer, I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, from conception to execution. My key contributions included:

* **Core Architecture:** I designed the modular Python architecture, which allows for new technologies and commands to be added easily as new functions.
* **Automation Scripting:** I wrote over 1,500 lines of Python code to handle user input, parse choices, and dynamically execute shell commands in the backend.
* **Cloud Integration:** I integrated the AWS `boto3` library to programmatically manage cloud resources, such as creating EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and CloudFront distributions directly from the menu.
* **Containerization & Orchestration:** I developed functions to interact with both the Docker daemon (to build/run containers) and the Kubernetes API (to manage pods and deployments), demonstrating a full-stack automation capability.

* **Cloud Platform:** AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
* **Primary Language:** Python (using the `boto3` library for AWS)
* **Operating System:** Linux
